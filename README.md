# VEsearch - A fully vegan recipe search engine.

This project started out as a passion project, as I'd not seen a fully vegan recipe search engine before and I felt ready to build something meaningful. I used all the knowledge I'd acquired through various Udemy courses to build this web application, and overall am happy with how it came out.

During the building of this app I learned more about functions, advanced DOM manipulation, promises and how to handle them, as well as more about object-oriented programming (despite not actually including any in the final code). I also downloaded a package bundler onto this project to experiment with modules and understand how they work. I think this project taught me quite a lot about how modules work, however, I will be exploring them deeper in my next project.

I could have added some sort of bookmarking feature to this app (using local storage), however, I felt the minimalist design would have been compromised and instead decided to use local storage on a future project. I feel this is an important part of designing web apps, as over-designing can make an app feel clunky or look messy.

The most important thing I learned from this specific project is the importance of file management, and having a project architecture before beginning. This will help not only keep the file organisation tidy but also keep the code readable and easier to debug.

For the time being I've included a 'config-example.js' file in this repository which simply needs renaming to 'config.js' in which one can add their own key if they wish to use this app.
