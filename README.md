# VEsearch - A fully vegan recipe search engine.

This project started out as a passion project, as I'd not seen a fully vegan recipe search engine before and I felt ready to build something meaningful. I used all the knowledge I'd acquired through various Udemy courses to build this web application, and overall am happy with how it came out.

During the building of this app I learned more about functions, advanced DOM manipulation, promises and how to handle them, as well as more about object-oriented programming (despite not actually including any in the final code). I also downloaded a package bundler onto this project to experiment with modules and understand how they work. I think this project taught me quite a lot about how modules work, however, I will be exploring the deeper in my next project.

I could have added some sort of bookmarking feature to this app (using local storage), however, I felt the minimalist design would have been compromised and instead decided to use local storage on a future project. I feel this is an important part of designing web apps, as over-designing can make an app feel clunky or look messy. I prefer to stick to a clean style.

The most important thing I learned from this specific project is the importance of file management, and having a project architecture before going beginning. This will help not only keep the file organisation tidy but also keep the code readable and easier to debug.

For the time being I've included a 'config-example.js' file in this repository which simply needs renaming to 'config.js' in which one can add their own key if they wish to use this app.
